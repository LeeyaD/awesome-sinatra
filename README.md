## Micro Frameworks inspired by Sinatra

* [Angelo](https://github.com/kenichi/angelo) - Sinatra-like DSL for Reel that supports WebSockets and SSE
  in their own thread, called "cells" (or actors). 
* [Gin](https://github.com/jcasts/gin) - A small Ruby web framework, built on Rack, which borrows from Sinatra expressiveness, 
  and targets larger applications.
* [Hobbit](https://github.com/patriciomacadden/hobbit) - A minimalistic microframework built on top of Rack (thanks to `Rack::Builder`).
   Hobbit is a DSL inspired by Sinatra. (~ 150 LOC).
* [Nancy](https://github.com/guilleiguaran/nancy) - Minimal Ruby microframework for web development inspired in `Sinatra` and `Cuba` (~150 LOC).
* [padrino](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework) - Padrino is a full-stack ruby framework built upon Sinatra.
* [Rack::App](https://github.com/rack-app/rack-app) - Bare bone minimalistic (masochistic) pico framework for building rack apps.
  Inspired by sinatra, grape and the pure use form of Rack.  
* [Sin](https://github.com/raggi/sin) - A multi-app web-app DSL derived from Sinatra, riding on rack.
  Sin is a rebuild of sinatra, splitting up the classes into files and going for a reusable application class.
* [Scorched](https://github.com/Wardrop/Scorched) - Light-weight, DRY as a desert, web framework for Ruby. Simliar to Sinatra. 
  Scorched is a true evolutionary enhancement of Sinatra, with more power, focus, and less clutter.
